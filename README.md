# Roomba
A roomba simulation which collects 3 different sizes of trash on the way.

Known 'bugs':
  - trash overlaps upon initial generation
  - roomba unable to 'dock' with the charging station
    - is unable to unload trash or recharge
  - momentarily changing the direction of the roomba through key input does not change the random angle it was initially set to
